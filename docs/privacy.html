      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 15, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
      <p>
        SpicySwipe is designed with a core principle of data minimization. We access public profile information (name,
        age, bio, interests) and active chat history only when the extension is active on <code>tinder.com</code>. This
        information is used strictly to power features like AI-suggested messages and conversation analytics.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data Storage & Local Processing</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Your data never leaves your device.</strong> All extracted profile details, chat logs, and extension
        settings are stored locally in your browser's private storage. We do not maintain any central database of user
        conversations.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party AI Services</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to use features powered by third-party AI (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, or DeepSeek),
        snippets of conversation context are sent directly to their respective APIs via secure HTTPS connections. Your
        data is governed by the privacy policies of those providers. SpicySwipe itself does not collect or monetize this
        data.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Anti-Detection & Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        The extension simulates mouse movements and keystrokes to provide a better user experience. These interactions
        are processed locally and are intended to provide natural human-like behavior within the Tinder interface.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You have complete control over your data. You can clear all extension data, reset your AI settings, or revoke
        consent at any time through the extension sidebar or by uninstalling the extension.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>
        API keys are stored using industry-standard browser encryption. We recommend users manage their independent AI
        service API keys securely and rotate them periodically.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Contact</h2>
